/* Coding Challenge #1
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is 
calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg 
and height in meter).
Your tasks:
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both 
versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about 
whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
Test data:
ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 
m tall.
ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 
m tall.*/

/*const marksHeight = 1.69;
const marksWeight = 78;
const johnHeight = 1.95;
const johnweight = 92;

const markBMI = marksWeight / (marksHeight * marksHeight);
const johnBMI = johnweight / (johnHeight * johnHeight);
const markHigherBMI = markBMI > johnBMI;
console.log(markBMI, johnBMI);
console.log(markHigherBMI);*/


const marksHeight = 1.88;
const marksWeight = 95;
const johnHeight = 1.76;
const johnweight = 85;

const markBMI = marksWeight / (marksHeight * marksHeight);
const johnBMI = johnweight / (johnHeight * johnHeight);
const markHigherBMI = markBMI > johnBMI;
console.log(markBMI, johnBMI);

console.log(markHigherBMI);
